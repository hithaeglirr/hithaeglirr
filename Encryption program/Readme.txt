Hello!
This is a simple program created by Andrei Raul Oltean. 
Everything in this app was made by me, including the logo. Even though it is not trademarked, i would ask that you respect its artistic integrity, however
little it may be.

This program is not meant to be used as a legitimate encryption tool, since the security of the messages was not my priority when making this program.
I am not responsible for whatever happens to any encrypted messages you try to share with someone else.

This app should only be used with ludic or otherwise educational purposes.

The application operates as follows:
In order to function, the app needs a key file specially made for it. The key consists of a .txt file containing a randomized string of ASCII characters.
If there is no key in your app folder, you can use the app to create a new one, or copy a key file from someone else in order to encrypt messages that
only they can read or to decrypt messages encrypted by them using the same key.

IMPORTANT NOTICE:
The app allows to rewrite a key, or to store your encrypted messages in a .txt file. If you wish to keep both of these intact, make sure to copy them
OUTSIDE of the app folder, otherwise they might be lost forever when you update a key or encrypt a new message.

Enjoy the application, and have fun sharing hidden messages with your peers!
